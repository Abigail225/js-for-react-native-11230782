This project consists of four tasks related to array manipulation and user profile creation.

### Task 1: Array Manipulation

arrayManipulation.js: This file contains two functions as follows:

1.  processArray: Takes an array of numbers as input, processes each element, squares it if it's even, or triples it if it's odd, and finally returns a new array.
2.  formatArrayStrings: Takes two arrays as input ;an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by processArray. It modifies each string depending on its corresponding figure or number.It capitalizies the entire string if the number is found to be even or divisible by 2, and converts the string to lowercase if it is an odd number.

### Task 2: Formatting Array Strings

The userInfo.js file contains the createUserProfiles function, take accepts an array of names and an array of the modified names from Task 1 as input values. an array of objects, each containing the original name, modified name, is returned and an automatic incrementation of id which begins from 1.

### Task 3: Creating User Profiles

- Create a file userInfo.js.
- Implement a function createUserProfiles that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2.
- The function returns an array of objects, each containing originalName, modifiedName, and id (auto-incremented starting from 1).

### Task 4: README File

- The README file gives an overall explanation on tasks taken, including a summarized description of each file and function, along with my student ID.
